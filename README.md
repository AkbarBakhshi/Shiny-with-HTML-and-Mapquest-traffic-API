# Quick Start Guide

This repo includes the code for the video where I show you how you can completely create your R Shiny UI with HTML and only keep the server side analysis in your R file. I will also show you how to access different APIs and then request information. For this video, I will be using Traffic API from MapQuest. Check out the full Youtube tutorial on the Data2Web channel in the link below:

## Before running the application in R Studio:
Make sure to sign up for a MapQuest account at https://developer.mapquest.com and get an API key. Then replace the API key used in the app.R file with your own. Otherwise, you will get an error that the API request failed.
